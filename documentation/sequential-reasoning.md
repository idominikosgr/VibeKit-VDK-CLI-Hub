# Sequential Reasoning Patterns

Sequential reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process where complex problems are broken down into logical steps, enabling systematic problem-solving and decision-making.

## Understanding Sequential Reasoning

### üéØ Core Concepts

**Sequential Reasoning** involves:

### üîÑ Dynamic Strategy Selection

Different reasoning strategies for different problem types:

**Analysis Strategy**: Breaking down complex problems
**Synthesis Strategy**: Combining information from multiple sources
**Evaluation Strategy**: Assessing options and alternatives
**Inference Strategy**: Drawing logical conclusions
**Validation Strategy**: Checking reasoning quality

## Reasoning Patterns

### 1. üéØ Deductive Reasoning

Moving from general principles to specific conclusions:

**Process:**
1. Establish major premise (general principle)
2. Apply minor premise (specific case)
3. Draw logical conclusion

**Example:**
- Major Premise: All mammals are warm-blooded
- Minor Premise: Dolphins are mammals
- Conclusion: Dolphins are warm-blooded

### 2. üîç Inductive Reasoning

Moving from specific observations to general patterns:

**Process:**
1. Collect specific observations
2. Identify recurring patterns
3. Formulate general hypothesis
4. Validate against new evidence

**Example:**
- Observations: Multiple successful AI implementations
- Pattern: Common architectural elements
- Hypothesis: Certain patterns lead to success

### 3. üîÑ Abductive Reasoning

Finding the best explanation for observations:

**Process:**
1. Identify puzzling phenomena
2. Generate possible explanations
3. Evaluate explanation quality
4. Select most plausible explanation

**Example:**
- Observation: System performance degradation
- Explanations: Hardware failure, software bug, network issues
- Best Explanation: Based on available evidence
