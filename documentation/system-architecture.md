# System Architecture Overview

Vibe Coding Rules Hub is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed for performance, reliability, and developer experience, with AI-first principles at its core.

## Architecture Principles

### üéØ Design Philosophy

- **AI-First**: Built specifically for AI assistant integration
- **Rule-Based**: Everything centers around reusable development rules
- **Collaborative**: Multi-user workflows with real-time features
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture for easy customization
- **Scalable by Default**: Built to handle growth from small teams to large enterprises

### üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack

The application uses a modern technology stack:

**Frontend:**
- React 19 with Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components
- TypeScript for type safety

**Backend:**
- Next.js API Routes
- Server Actions
- Middleware for authentication

**Database:**
- Supabase PostgreSQL
- Real-time subscriptions
- Row Level Security (RLS)

**Services:**
- GitHub synchronization
- Authentication with OAuth
- File storage and management

## Core Components

### üìä Data Layer

The application uses Supabase PostgreSQL with the following core entities:

**Core Tables:**
- **rules**: Core content with metadata and versioning
- **categories**: Hierarchical organization system
- **users**: Authentication and profile management
- **collections**: User-curated rule sets
- **documentation**: Notion-like wiki system

**Collaboration:**
- **comments**: Rule discussions and feedback
- **votes**: Community rating system
- **bookmarks**: User bookmarks and favorites
- **subscriptions**: Notification preferences

**System:**
- **audit_logs**: Change tracking and compliance
- **sync_logs**: GitHub synchronization history
- **analytics_events**: Usage analytics and metrics

### üîÑ Business Logic

#### Rule Management
- Automatic GitHub synchronization
- Version control and history
- Compatibility matrices
- Download tracking

#### User Experience
- Setup wizard for rule generation
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Advanced search and filtering
- Collection management

#### Administrative Tools
- Content management dashboard
- Analytics and monitoring
- User management
- System configuration

## Data Flow

### 1. Rule Synchronization

```
GitHub Repository ‚Üí Sync Service ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí API ‚Üí UI
```

### 2. User Interactions

```
User Action ‚Üí Client ‚Üí API Route ‚Üí Service Layer ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Real-time Update
```

### 3. Content Generation

```
Wizard Input ‚Üí Rule Matching ‚Üí Template Engine ‚Üí Package Generation ‚Üí Download
```

## API Architecture

### RESTful API Design

**Core Endpoints:**
- `/api/auth/` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/rules/` - Rule management
- `/api/categories/` - Category operations
- `/api/collections/` - User collections
- `/api/docs/` - Documentation system
- `/api/admin/` - Administrative functions
- `/api/webhooks/` - External integrations

**Key Patterns:**
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Request/response validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Security Model

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth with OAuth providers
- JWT-based session management
- Role-based access control

### Authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Admin-only functions
- Content visibility controls

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Performance Architecture

### Optimization Strategies
- **Database**: Optimized indexes and queries
- **Caching**: Strategic cache layers
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery
- **Real-time**: Efficient subscription management

### Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal database scaling
- Serverless function deployment
- Edge computing capabilities
- Progressive loading strategies

### Multi-Level Caching

```
CDN Cache (Vercel) ‚Üí Server Cache (Redis) ‚Üí Application Cache ‚Üí Database Cache
```

### Database Optimization

- Connection Pooling: Efficient database connections
- Query Optimization: Indexed queries and joins
- Read Replicas: Distributed read operations
- Materialized Views: Pre-computed aggregations

### Client-Side Performance

- Code Splitting: Lazy loading of components
- Image Optimization: Next.js image optimization
- Bundle Analysis: Monitoring bundle sizes
- Core Web Vitals: Performance monitoring

## Frontend Architecture

### Next.js Application
- **App Router**: Modern routing with layouts and loading states
- **Server Components**: Performance-optimized rendering
- **Client Components**: Interactive UI with React hooks
- **Middleware**: Authentication and route protection

### Key Features
