# Knowledge Graph Design

Knowledge graphs provide a powerful way to represent, store, and query complex relationships between entities, enabling AI systems to maintain rich contextual understanding across interactions.

## Fundamentals

## Example Implementation

### Basic Knowledge Graph Schema

```typescript
interface Entity {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  label: string;
  attributes: Record<string, any>;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}

interface Relationship {
  id: string;
  source_id: string;
  target_id: string;
  type: string;
  attributes: Record<string, any>;
  weight?: number;
  created_at: Date;
}

interface Context {
  id: string;
  entity_id: string;
  temporal_info?: {
    valid_from: Date;
    valid_to?: Date;
  };
  spatial_info?: {
    location: string;
    coordinates?: [number, number];
  };
  domain_info?: {
    domain: string;
    subdomain?: string;
  };
}
```

### Query Examples

```cypher
// Find all technologies used by a specific team
MATCH (team:Team)-[:USES]->(tech:Technology)
WHERE team.name = "Frontend Team"
RETURN tech.name, tech.version

// Discover related concepts
MATCH (concept:Concept)-[:RELATED_TO*1..3]-(related:Concept)
WHERE concept.name = "Agentic AI"
RETURN related.name, length(path) as distance

// Find expertise gaps
MATCH (project:Project)-[:REQUIRES]->(skill:Skill)
WHERE NOT (project)<-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(skill)
RETURN project.name, skill.name as missing_skill
```

Knowledge graphs provide the foundation for intelligent, context-aware AI systems. By implementing these patterns and optimization strategies, you can build systems that maintain rich, queryable representations of complex domains and relationships.
